Two questions to solve.

Q1.
Made use of a while loop and recursion to display two ways of providing solution to a population forecast problem. 

Q2.
Made use of bubble sort to provide solution to an array sorting problem. This has room for improvement as a merge sort can
also be used and it will provide better performance as the number of array elements increases.
